pc-software
===========

Contains a command line application to talk to the bootloader.

Three build environments are supported:

linux: type "make"

Microsoft Visual VC++ 6: use bootloader.dsp

Microsoft Visual Studio 2005: use bootloader.sln


The firmware image can be embedded into the binary using the
encodefirmware.pl perl script.


The license can be found in pc-software/LICENSE.txt

If you don't like the license feel free to ask, I'll probably let you
use it under a different license.

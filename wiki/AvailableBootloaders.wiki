#summary List of available Microchip PIC bootloaders

= Introduction =

This is a list of all the available Microchip PIC bootloaders and major features.

= Desirable boot loader properties =

For a bootloader to be useful in a commercial project, there are a number of properties that it should have:

  * boot loader runs from the PIC boot block which can be protected (this helps ensure the bootloader never becomes corrupted)
  * PIC Source code should be available (otherwise it can't be ported to new PICs, different baud rates, etc)
  * PC side source code should be available (so you can produce a professional looking firmware upgrade tool or alter it if there is a special way to enter the bootloader on your product)
  * The bootloader should run briefly when the PIC boots (so that you can recover if the underlying application has been corrupted)
  * The data written should be verified

Obviously, ideally, it should be free too.

= Details of free bootloaders for Microchip PICs =

http://www.etc.ugal.ro/cchiculita/software/picbootloader.htm - tinyboot loader: good, but PC app source code not available

http://forum.microchip.com/tm.aspx?m=126770 - wombat encrypted serial: very good, but you need a C compiler for the PIC

http://www.fatih.edu.tr/~onur/PIC18F452/Colt%20Bootloader/Colt%20PIC18F%20Bootloader%20Page.htm - Colt bootloader - good, but no source code available for PIC or PC

http://mrmackey.no-ip.org/elektronik/ds30loader/ - good. GPL licensed but can be used with closed-source/commercial firmware, all source provided, supports wide range of PICs.

http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1824&appnote=en012031 - microchip an851 - good, but PC app is in obsolete Visual Basic 6.0 and bootloader doesn't run when PIC boots.

http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1824&appnote=en546974 - microchip AN1310 - now looks very good, though should not be used with code protection as it will allow the firmware to be read out

http://picloader.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/picloader/bootloader/ - usb bootloader, encryption support

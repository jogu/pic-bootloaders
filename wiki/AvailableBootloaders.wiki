#summary List of available Microchip PIC bootloaders

= Introduction =

This is a list of all the available Microchip PIC bootloaders and major features.

= Desirable boot loader properties =

There are a number of properties that a boot loader should have:

  * boot loader runs from the PIC boot block which can be protected (this helps ensure the bootloader never becomes corrupted)
  * PIC Source code should be available (otherwise it can't be ported to new PICs, different baud rates, etc)
  * PC side source code should be available (so you can produce a professional looking firmware upgrade tool)
  * The bootloader should run briefly when the PIC boots (so that you can recover if the underlying application has been corrupted)

Obviously, ideally, it should be free.
